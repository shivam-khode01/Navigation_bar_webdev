Project Title: Custom Navigation Bar with HTML and CSS

Description:
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a sleek and responsive navigation bar created entirely using HTML and CSS. In this project, I've utilized a combination of basic and advanced CSS3 properties to design a versatile navigation bar that not only enhances the visual appeal of your website but also ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Key Features:

Pure HTML and CSS: The navigation bar is crafted using only HTML for the structure and CSS for styling, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.

Responsive Design: The navigation bar is designed to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices.

CSS Flexbox and Grid: I've employed both Flexbox and Grid layout techniques to achieve a well-organized and flexible structure, allowing for easy customization.

Transitions and Animations: Enhance the user interface with subtle transitions and animations, adding a touch of interactivity to the navigation elements.

Custom Styling: Explore the use of advanced CSS properties such as gradients, shadows, and custom fonts to give your navigation bar a unique and professional appearance.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the HTML file in your preferred web browser or integrate the code into your existing project.
Customize the navigation items, colors, and styles to match your website's design.
